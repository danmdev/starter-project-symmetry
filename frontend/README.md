# Flutter Frontend
In this folder are all the [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) related files.
This folder is essentially the app and what the user sees. 
It has a dependency to the backend which ensures that there is data consistency.
You will be doing most of your work in this folder.

## Getting Started
Before you can run the app, you will need to add the Firebase options file to this project.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Complete the [backend tutorial](../backend/README.md) to create a Firebase project which satisfies the requirements
2. Watch this [tutorial to setup Firebase for Flutter](https://youtu.be/Wa0rdbb53I8?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC)
Once you have completed this appropriately, you can start to work with the project.

### Generate files for routing, di etc.:
`flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
### Generate the icons:
`flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`
### Install the Project Dependencies (in pubsec.yaml)
`flutter pub get`

### How can I best understand this project?
In order to best understand this project and its underlying intricacies, we recommend that you watch this tutorial: [Flutter Clean Architecture Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V_P6dovixg).
This tutorial **literally builds this project from the ground up** so we really recommend you watch it before developing.

Furthermore, we will now leave the index of this project with all the documentation that must be read before contributing to the frontend.
